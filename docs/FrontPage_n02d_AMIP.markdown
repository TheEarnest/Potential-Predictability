Full field SST assimilated Ocean of NorESM (2nd version)
==========

  * The results (in global map) can be found in the following pages. Note that the results won't be shown if the PPP is smaller than __0.001__.

    * __Finished on ?? ?? 2015__
    * Data is kept @Norstore-osl:
    * We using [Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM)] (http://folk.uib.no/ngfhd/EarthClim/)
    * Applying full-field SST ([HadISST2](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst2/)) assimilation ([EnKF](http://enkf.nersc.no/), 30 members) on ocean compartment only
    * From __1970-2010__
