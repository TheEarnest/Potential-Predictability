AMIP simulation with 1 day atmospheric nudging 
==========

  * The results (in global map) can be found in the following pages. Note that the results won't be shown if the PPP is smaller than __0.001__.

    * [__CAM__] (n01d_AMIP/PPP_atm2.markdown), total figures in atm (n01d_AMIP): __0__
    * [__CLM__] (n01d_AMIP/PPP_lnd.markdown), total figures in lnd (n01d_AMIP): __0__
    * [__CICE__] (n01d_AMIP/PPP_ice.markdown), total figures in ice (n01d_AMIP): __0__

  * About this analysis:
    * __Finished on ?? Feb. 2016__
    * Data is kept @Norstore-osl:
    * We use [Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM)] (http://folk.uib.no/ngfhd/EarthClim/)
    * Model compset is FAMIPCN with resolution f19_f19 (~2 degree)
    * From __1982-2006__
    * Surface SST forcing is from [OISST] (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst) 
    * Atmosphere nudging was applyed from 600 hPa to model top.
      * relaxation coefficient is 0.0208 (relaxation time scale is one day)
    * Known issue: None. 
    * PPP of air surface temperature  ![] (../figures/n01d_AMIP/PPP_atm/PPP_All_G04.cam2.h0.TS.png)
  * Notes on this prediction:
