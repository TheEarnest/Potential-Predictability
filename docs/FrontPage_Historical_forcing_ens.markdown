==========

  * The results (in global map) can be found in the following pages. Note that the results won't be shown if the PPP is smaller than __0.001__.

    * [__MICOM__] (Historical_forcing_ens/PPP_ocn.markdown), presented/total figures in ocn: __17__/999 
    * [__CAM__] (Historical_forcing_ens/PPP_atm2.markdown), presented/total figures in atm: __1__/170 
    * [__CLM__] (Historical_forcing_ens/PPP_lnd.markdown), presented/total figures in lnd: __146__/216

  * About this analysis:
    * __Finished on 10 Mar. 2014__
    * Data is kept @Norstore-osl:/projects/NS9039K/shared/norcpm/cases/Historical_forcing_ens
    * We use [ Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM)] (http://folk.uib.no/ngfhd/EarthClim/) version F19_tn21 (approximately two degree atmosphere and two degree ocean)
    * From __1850-2004__, but the evaluation is only applied for the period __1960-2004__
